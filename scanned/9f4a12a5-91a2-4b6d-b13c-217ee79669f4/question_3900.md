# Q3900: shared prefix forks whose ancestors arrive in updateTracer

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach updateTracer with shared-prefix forks whose ancestors arrive after descendants and candidate fragment shape, rollback points, withheld bodies, stale blocks, competing branch timing, and peer disconnection timing, then confuse header/body, era, or storage context in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/ChainDB/Impl/Args.hs / updateTracer
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends adversarial but protocol-reachable ChainSync headers, BlockFetch bodies, duplicates, and rollbacks through normal node-to-node syncing.
- Attacker controls: candidate fragment shape, rollback points, withheld bodies, stale blocks, competing branch timing, and peer disconnection timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `updateTracer` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.ChainDB.Impl.Args` through the production entrypoint using shared-prefix forks whose ancestors arrive after descendants; verify whether the path can confuse header/body, era, or storage context before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Invalid or unavailable block bodies must not permanently poison candidate selection or syncing progress.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable peer data makes honest nodes prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain beyond intended security assumptions.
- Fast validation: Write a ChainDB state-machine test that feeds identical fragments in different orders and asserts selected tip equality.
