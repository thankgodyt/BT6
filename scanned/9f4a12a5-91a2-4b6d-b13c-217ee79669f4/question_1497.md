# Q1497: invalid block persistence followed by valid sibling arrival in blockOrEBB

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach blockOrEBB with invalid block persistence followed by valid sibling arrival and valid and invalid block order, file/chunk boundary reached through normal sync, ledger snapshot choice, replay order, and chain selection state, then make replay after restart differ from live validation in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/ImmutableDB/Impl.hs / blockOrEBB
- Entrypoint: Remote peers drive normal block synchronization so accepted, rejected, duplicate, or rolled-back blocks are persisted, replayed, snapshotted, or cleaned up by production storage.
- Attacker controls: valid and invalid block order, file/chunk boundary reached through normal sync, ledger snapshot choice, replay order, and chain selection state.
- Exploit idea: Drive `blockOrEBB` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.ImmutableDB.Impl` through the production entrypoint using invalid block persistence followed by valid sibling arrival; verify whether the path can make replay after restart differ from live validation before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Volatile and immutable storage boundaries must not make valid blocks disappear or invalid blocks become canonical.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if peer-derived storage, snapshot, replay, or rollback state causes durable use of the wrong ledger state or permanent rejection of a valid chain.
- Fast validation: Run a storage state-machine test that syncs adversarial block sequences, restarts, and compares selected tip plus ledger state hash.
