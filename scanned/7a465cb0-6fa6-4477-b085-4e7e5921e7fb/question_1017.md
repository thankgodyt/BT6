# Q1017: serialized header bytes in Ouroboros Consensus Protocol Praos Views

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Praos.Views with serialized header bytes with equivalent visible fields and header fields, slot numbers, issuer keys, VRF proof bytes, KES signature bytes, operational certificates, body hash, and predecessor hash, then make a valid block permanently or durably rejected in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus-protocol/src/ouroboros-consensus-protocol/Ouroboros/Consensus/Protocol/Praos/Views.hs / Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Praos.Views
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends crafted headers/blocks, or a normal slot leader produces an edge-case block that honest nodes validate through the production consensus path.
- Attacker controls: header fields, slot numbers, issuer keys, VRF proof bytes, KES signature bytes, operational certificates, body hash, and predecessor hash.
- Exploit idea: Drive `Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Praos.Views` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Praos.Views` through the production entrypoint using serialized header bytes with equivalent visible fields; verify whether the path can make a valid block permanently or durably rejected before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A block/header accepted by consensus must satisfy the protocol, ledger-view, issuer, slot, and signature assumptions for that exact state.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if the path lets a crafted block/header or protocol-reachable input make an honest node accept an invalid block, invalid ledger state, or divergent irreversible chain.
- Fast validation: Construct a validation property that mutates controlled header fields and compares header validation, body validation, and ledger application.
