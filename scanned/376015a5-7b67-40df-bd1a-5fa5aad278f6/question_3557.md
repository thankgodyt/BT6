# Q3557: future headers queued until slot becomes current in DurationFromNow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach DurationFromNow with future headers queued until slot becomes current and normal adversarial network scheduling, delayed data, replayed announcements, fork delivery order, and diffusion-to-consensus callback timing, then make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus-diffusion/src/ouroboros-consensus-diffusion/Ouroboros/Consensus/Node/GSM.hs / DurationFromNow
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged node-to-node or node-to-client peer sends supported protocol messages, rollbacks, block bodies, queries, or object-diffusion data in adversarial order.
- Attacker controls: normal adversarial network scheduling, delayed data, replayed announcements, fork delivery order, and diffusion-to-consensus callback timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `DurationFromNow` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Node.GSM` through the production entrypoint using future headers queued until slot becomes current; verify whether the path can make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Disconnect/reconnect and Genesis sync transitions must not leave stale peer state that affects chain selection.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Medium if an unprivileged peer can cause repeated expensive consensus work with near-valid data without flood-style DoS.
- Fast validation: Add a ChainSync/BlockFetch integration test with withheld bodies and a complete competing chain.
