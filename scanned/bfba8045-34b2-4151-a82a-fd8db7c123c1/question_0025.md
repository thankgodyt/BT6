# Q25: a header accepted before the body hash is checked in PraosEnvelopeError

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach PraosEnvelopeError with a header accepted before the body hash is checked and header fields, slot numbers, issuer keys, VRF proof bytes, KES signature bytes, operational certificates, body hash, and predecessor hash, then cause honest nodes to select different tips in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus-cardano/src/shelley/Ouroboros/Consensus/Shelley/Protocol/Praos.hs / PraosEnvelopeError
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends crafted headers/blocks, or a normal slot leader produces an edge-case block that honest nodes validate through the production consensus path.
- Attacker controls: header fields, slot numbers, issuer keys, VRF proof bytes, KES signature bytes, operational certificates, body hash, and predecessor hash.
- Exploit idea: Drive `PraosEnvelopeError` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Shelley.Protocol.Praos` through the production entrypoint using a header accepted before the body hash is checked; verify whether the path can cause honest nodes to select different tips before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A block/header accepted by consensus must satisfy the protocol, ledger-view, issuer, slot, and signature assumptions for that exact state.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if the path lets a crafted block/header or protocol-reachable input make an honest node accept an invalid block, invalid ledger state, or divergent irreversible chain.
- Fast validation: Construct a validation property that mutates controlled header fields and compares header validation, body validation, and ledger application.
