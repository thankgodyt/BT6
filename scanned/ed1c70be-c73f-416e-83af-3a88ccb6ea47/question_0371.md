# Q371: serialized header bytes in Ouroboros Consensus Protocol Signed

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Signed with serialized header bytes with equivalent visible fields and header fields, slot numbers, issuer keys, VRF proof bytes, KES signature bytes, operational certificates, body hash, and predecessor hash, then reuse stale validation or ledger context in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Protocol/Signed.hs / Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Signed
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends crafted headers/blocks, or a normal slot leader produces an edge-case block that honest nodes validate through the production consensus path.
- Attacker controls: header fields, slot numbers, issuer keys, VRF proof bytes, KES signature bytes, operational certificates, body hash, and predecessor hash.
- Exploit idea: Drive `Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Signed` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.Signed` through the production entrypoint using serialized header bytes with equivalent visible fields; verify whether the path can reuse stale validation or ledger context before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A block/header accepted by consensus must satisfy the protocol, ledger-view, issuer, slot, and signature assumptions for that exact state.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable peer data makes honest nodes prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain beyond intended security assumptions.
- Fast validation: Fuzz serialized headers and body-hash mismatches while asserting no cached-valid reuse across predecessor contexts.
