# Q1635: near valid protocol data reaching expensive paths in Evidence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach Evidence with near-valid protocol data reaching expensive paths and block/header fields, peer scheduling, rollback points, and node state observed through normal protocols, then confuse header/body, era, or storage context in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Util/Pred.hs / Evidence
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or local public client reaches this production consensus path with protocol-valid or near-valid data through supported node interfaces.
- Attacker controls: block/header fields, peer scheduling, rollback points, and node state observed through normal protocols.
- Exploit idea: Drive `Evidence` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Util.Pred` through the production entrypoint using near-valid protocol data reaching expensive paths; verify whether the path can confuse header/body, era, or storage context before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Protocol-valid inputs must not trigger unbounded work before decisive rejection or acceptance.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable data makes honest nodes prefer different chain state.
- Fast validation: Write a property test that feeds equivalent fragments in different valid orders and compares selected tip, ledger hash, and consensus state.
