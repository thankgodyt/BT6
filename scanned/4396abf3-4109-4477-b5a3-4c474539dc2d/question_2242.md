# Q2242: serialized data reused under another context in Ouroboros Consensus Block EBB

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach Ouroboros.Consensus.Block.EBB with serialized data reused under another context and slots, points, hashes, fragments, peer timing, rollbacks, serialized data, and restart timing, then cause honest nodes to select different tips in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/EBB.hs / Ouroboros.Consensus.Block.EBB
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or local public client reaches this production consensus path with protocol-valid or near-valid data through supported node interfaces.
- Attacker controls: slots, points, hashes, fragments, peer timing, rollbacks, serialized data, and restart timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `Ouroboros.Consensus.Block.EBB` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Block.EBB` through the production entrypoint using serialized data reused under another context; verify whether the path can cause honest nodes to select different tips before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Consensus state derived from peer data must be deterministic across honest nodes that eventually receive the same valid inputs.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Medium if near-valid data creates sustained resource exhaustion without prohibited flood-style DoS.
- Fast validation: Fuzz boundary slots, points, hashes, and serialized values and assert rejection happens before partial state update.
