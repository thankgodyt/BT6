# Q406: old era chain selection data influencing new era preference in cfg

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach cfg with old-era chain selection data influencing new-era preference and transition ledger state, protocol parameter translation, forecast window, current-era tip, and historical summary reconstruction inputs, then make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus-cardano/src/ouroboros-consensus-cardano/Ouroboros/Consensus/Cardano/Node.hs / cfg
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or normal block producer delivers blocks, headers, queries, or encoded messages around an era boundary through supported node protocols.
- Attacker controls: transition ledger state, protocol parameter translation, forecast window, current-era tip, and historical summary reconstruction inputs.
- Exploit idea: Drive `cfg` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Cardano.Node` through the production entrypoint using old-era chain selection data influencing new-era preference; verify whether the path can make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Forecast windows and ledger views must not allow stale pre-transition context to validate post-transition blocks.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if a crafted boundary block causes honest nodes to disagree on block validity or accept invalid state.
- Fast validation: Replay the same multi-era chain live and from persisted storage and compare hard-fork summary, selected tip, and ledger state hash.
