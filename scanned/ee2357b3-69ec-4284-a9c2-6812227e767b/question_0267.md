# Q267: transactions applied in a different order in stakePoolRelayAccessPoint

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach stakePoolRelayAccessPoint with transactions applied in a different order after replay and serialized ledger-related data, block body size, transaction ordering, replayed blocks, and forecast-derived ledger view, then starve a valid competing chain without prohibited flood-style DoS in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Ledger/SupportsPeerSelection.hs / stakePoolRelayAccessPoint
- Entrypoint: Remote peer provides blocks/transactions that drive consensus ledger validation, replay, snapshots, or queries through normal node operation.
- Attacker controls: serialized ledger-related data, block body size, transaction ordering, replayed blocks, and forecast-derived ledger view.
- Exploit idea: Drive `stakePoolRelayAccessPoint` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Ledger.SupportsPeerSelection` through the production entrypoint using transactions applied in a different order after replay; verify whether the path can starve a valid competing chain without prohibited flood-style DoS before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Consensus and ledger validity must remain deterministic for the same block and predecessor chain.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if consensus accepts a block whose ledger transition is invalid under the selected state.
- Fast validation: Create a ledger integration property comparing consensus validation, direct ledger application, and replay from snapshot.
