# Q2430: ledger translation during rollback across an era boundary in dispatchEncoder

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach dispatchEncoder with ledger translation during rollback across an era boundary and node-to-node encoded blocks, node-to-client query/result encodings, era indexes, hard-fork state telescope position, and rollback point, then cause honest nodes to select different tips in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/HardFork/Combinator/Serialisation/SerialiseNodeToNode.hs / dispatchEncoder
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or normal block producer delivers blocks, headers, queries, or encoded messages around an era boundary through supported node protocols.
- Attacker controls: node-to-node encoded blocks, node-to-client query/result encodings, era indexes, hard-fork state telescope position, and rollback point.
- Exploit idea: Drive `dispatchEncoder` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.Combinator.Serialisation.SerialiseNodeToNode` through the production entrypoint using ledger translation during rollback across an era boundary; verify whether the path can cause honest nodes to select different tips before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Node-to-node and node-to-client version negotiation must not decode one era or query as another.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if replay or rollback across an era boundary makes honest nodes select different valid-chain tips.
- Fast validation: Fuzz node-to-node/node-to-client version tags and era indexes and assert mismatched payloads are rejected before validation.
