# Q3903: headers for a preferred candidate whose bodies arrive late in olderThanImmTip

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach olderThanImmTip with headers for a preferred candidate whose bodies arrive late and valid-looking headers, delayed or invalid block bodies, fork length, predecessor hashes, slot numbers, duplicate announcements, and arrival order, then make a valid block permanently or durably rejected in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/ChainDB/Impl/ChainSel.hs / olderThanImmTip
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends adversarial but protocol-reachable ChainSync headers, BlockFetch bodies, duplicates, and rollbacks through normal node-to-node syncing.
- Attacker controls: valid-looking headers, delayed or invalid block bodies, fork length, predecessor hashes, slot numbers, duplicate announcements, and arrival order.
- Exploit idea: Drive `olderThanImmTip` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.ChainDB.Impl.ChainSel` through the production entrypoint using headers for a preferred candidate whose bodies arrive late; verify whether the path can make a valid block permanently or durably rejected before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Honest nodes receiving the same valid chain data must eventually select the same best chain regardless of arrival order.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable peer data makes honest nodes prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain beyond intended security assumptions.
- Fast validation: Write a ChainDB state-machine test that feeds identical fragments in different orders and asserts selected tip equality.
