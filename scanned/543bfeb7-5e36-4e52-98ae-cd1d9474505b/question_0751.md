# Q751: pre transition fragments delivered in LegacyShelleyGenesis

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach LegacyShelleyGenesis with pre-transition fragments delivered after post-transition blocks and pre-transition fragments, post-transition blocks, translation boundary, stale era context, query dispatch tags, and replay order, then make replay after restart differ from live validation in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus-cardano/src/shelley/Ouroboros/Consensus/Shelley/Ledger/Query/LegacyShelleyGenesis.hs / LegacyShelleyGenesis
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or normal block producer delivers blocks, headers, queries, or encoded messages around an era boundary through supported node protocols.
- Attacker controls: pre-transition fragments, post-transition blocks, translation boundary, stale era context, query dispatch tags, and replay order.
- Exploit idea: Drive `LegacyShelleyGenesis` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Shelley.Ledger.Query.LegacyShelleyGenesis` through the production entrypoint using pre-transition fragments delivered after post-transition blocks; verify whether the path can make replay after restart differ from live validation before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Ledger translation across eras must preserve the consensus state required for chain selection and block validation.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if a crafted boundary block causes honest nodes to disagree on block validity or accept invalid state.
- Fast validation: Replay the same multi-era chain live and from persisted storage and compare hard-fork summary, selected tip, and ledger state hash.
