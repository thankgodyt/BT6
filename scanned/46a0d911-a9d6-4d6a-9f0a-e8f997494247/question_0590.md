# Q590: ledger error wrapping that hides fatal validation failure in tickedHeaderState

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach tickedHeaderState with ledger error wrapping that hides fatal validation failure and serialized ledger-related data, block body size, transaction ordering, replayed blocks, and forecast-derived ledger view, then make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Ledger/Extended.hs / tickedHeaderState
- Entrypoint: Remote peer provides blocks/transactions that drive consensus ledger validation, replay, snapshots, or queries through normal node operation.
- Attacker controls: serialized ledger-related data, block body size, transaction ordering, replayed blocks, and forecast-derived ledger view.
- Exploit idea: Drive `tickedHeaderState` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Ledger.Extended` through the production entrypoint using ledger error wrapping that hides fatal validation failure; verify whether the path can make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Consensus and ledger validity must remain deterministic for the same block and predecessor chain.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if snapshot/replay restores a ledger state inconsistent with the selected chain.
- Fast validation: Construct block-body transaction ordering tests and compare mempool acceptance against block application.
