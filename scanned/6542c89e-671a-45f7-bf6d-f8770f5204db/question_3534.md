# Q3534: orphaned descendants retained across recovery in nonIncreasing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach nonIncreasing with orphaned descendants retained across recovery and block body bytes, index entries derived from accepted blocks, orphaned descendants, cleanup timing, and repeated near-valid candidates, then force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/ImmutableDB/Impl/Validation.hs / nonIncreasing
- Entrypoint: Remote peers drive normal block synchronization so accepted, rejected, duplicate, or rolled-back blocks are persisted, replayed, snapshotted, or cleaned up by production storage.
- Attacker controls: block body bytes, index entries derived from accepted blocks, orphaned descendants, cleanup timing, and repeated near-valid candidates.
- Exploit idea: Drive `nonIncreasing` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.ImmutableDB.Impl.Validation` through the production entrypoint using orphaned descendants retained across recovery; verify whether the path can force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Duplicate, stale, or near-valid peer data must not cause durable database state that blocks future valid synchronization.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Medium if protocol-reachable data causes sustained storage/index churn without prohibited flood-style DoS.
- Fast validation: Create a LedgerDB snapshot/replay property comparing restored state to fresh replay from the immutable anchor.
