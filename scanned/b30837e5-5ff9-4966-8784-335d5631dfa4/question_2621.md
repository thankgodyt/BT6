# Q2621: a candidate crossing the volatile to immutable boundary in ModChainSel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach ModChainSel with a candidate crossing the volatile-to-immutable boundary and fork density, chain fragment ancestry, invalid descendant timing, validation cache pressure, and restart boundary timing, then starve a valid competing chain without prohibited flood-style DoS in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Protocol/ModChainSel.hs / ModChainSel
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends adversarial but protocol-reachable ChainSync headers, BlockFetch bodies, duplicates, and rollbacks through normal node-to-node syncing.
- Attacker controls: fork density, chain fragment ancestry, invalid descendant timing, validation cache pressure, and restart boundary timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `ModChainSel` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Protocol.ModChainSel` through the production entrypoint using a candidate crossing the volatile-to-immutable boundary; verify whether the path can starve a valid competing chain without prohibited flood-style DoS before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A candidate fragment must not become preferred unless every required predecessor and validation result is consistent.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Medium if an unprivileged peer can cause sustained consensus/storage resource exhaustion through protocol-valid or near-valid data without prohibited flood-style DoS.
- Fast validation: Build a rollback/replay property comparing restored ledger state against fresh replay from the immutable anchor.
