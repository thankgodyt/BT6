# Q3142: headers for a preferred candidate whose bodies arrive late in computePath

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach computePath with headers for a preferred candidate whose bodies arrive late and valid-looking headers, delayed or invalid block bodies, fork length, predecessor hashes, slot numbers, duplicate announcements, and arrival order, then force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/ChainDB/Impl/Paths.hs / computePath
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends adversarial but protocol-reachable ChainSync headers, BlockFetch bodies, duplicates, and rollbacks through normal node-to-node syncing.
- Attacker controls: valid-looking headers, delayed or invalid block bodies, fork length, predecessor hashes, slot numbers, duplicate announcements, and arrival order.
- Exploit idea: Drive `computePath` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.ChainDB.Impl.Paths` through the production entrypoint using headers for a preferred candidate whose bodies arrive late; verify whether the path can force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Honest nodes receiving the same valid chain data must eventually select the same best chain regardless of arrival order.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable peer data makes honest nodes prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain beyond intended security assumptions.
- Fast validation: Write a ChainDB state-machine test that feeds identical fragments in different orders and asserts selected tip equality.
