# Q16: candidate switching while cleanup is eligible in getImmutableLedger

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach getImmutableLedger with candidate switching while cleanup is eligible and fork density, chain fragment ancestry, invalid descendant timing, validation cache pressure, and restart boundary timing, then confuse header/body, era, or storage context in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/ChainDB/Impl/Query.hs / getImmutableLedger
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends adversarial but protocol-reachable ChainSync headers, BlockFetch bodies, duplicates, and rollbacks through normal node-to-node syncing.
- Attacker controls: fork density, chain fragment ancestry, invalid descendant timing, validation cache pressure, and restart boundary timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `getImmutableLedger` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.ChainDB.Impl.Query` through the production entrypoint using candidate switching while cleanup is eligible; verify whether the path can confuse header/body, era, or storage context before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A candidate fragment must not become preferred unless every required predecessor and validation result is consistent.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable peer data makes honest nodes prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain beyond intended security assumptions.
- Fast validation: Write a ChainDB state-machine test that feeds identical fragments in different orders and asserts selected tip equality.
