# Q2606: restart replay in indexedPackedByteCount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach indexedPackedByteCount with restart replay after normal synchronization and near-valid blocks or messages, chain fragment shape, state transition ordering, and replay/recovery timing, then cause honest nodes to select different tips in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Util/IndexedMemPack.hs / indexedPackedByteCount
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or local public client reaches this production consensus path with protocol-valid or near-valid data through supported node interfaces.
- Attacker controls: near-valid blocks or messages, chain fragment shape, state transition ordering, and replay/recovery timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `indexedPackedByteCount` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Util.IndexedMemPack` through the production entrypoint using restart replay after normal synchronization; verify whether the path can cause honest nodes to select different tips before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Restart, rollback, and replay must not change the security meaning of an already validated chain fragment.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if a crafted input makes consensus accept invalid state.
- Fast validation: Create a restart/replay test from persisted state and compare it with the pre-restart in-memory state.
