# Q657: a candidate crossing the volatile to immutable boundary in OneEraReasonForSwit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach OneEraReasonForSwitch with a candidate crossing the volatile-to-immutable boundary and fork density, chain fragment ancestry, invalid descendant timing, validation cache pressure, and restart boundary timing, then confuse header/body, era, or storage context in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/HardFork/Combinator/Protocol/ChainSel.hs / OneEraReasonForSwitch
- Entrypoint: Remote peer sends adversarial but protocol-reachable ChainSync headers, BlockFetch bodies, duplicates, and rollbacks through normal node-to-node syncing.
- Attacker controls: fork density, chain fragment ancestry, invalid descendant timing, validation cache pressure, and restart boundary timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `OneEraReasonForSwitch` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.Combinator.Protocol.ChainSel` through the production entrypoint using a candidate crossing the volatile-to-immutable boundary; verify whether the path can confuse header/body, era, or storage context before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A candidate fragment must not become preferred unless every required predecessor and validation result is consistent.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial but protocol-reachable peer data makes honest nodes prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain beyond intended security assumptions.
- Fast validation: Write a ChainDB state-machine test that feeds identical fragments in different orders and asserts selected tip equality.
