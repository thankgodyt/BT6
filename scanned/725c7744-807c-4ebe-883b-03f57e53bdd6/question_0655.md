# Q655: boundary slots points and hashes in VersionError

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach VersionError with boundary slots, points, and hashes and slots, points, hashes, fragments, peer timing, rollbacks, serialized data, and restart timing, then make a valid block permanently or durably rejected in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Util/Versioned.hs / VersionError
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or local public client reaches this production consensus path with protocol-valid or near-valid data through supported node interfaces.
- Attacker controls: slots, points, hashes, fragments, peer timing, rollbacks, serialized data, and restart timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `VersionError` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Util.Versioned` through the production entrypoint using boundary slots, points, and hashes; verify whether the path can make a valid block permanently or durably rejected before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Consensus state derived from peer data must be deterministic across honest nodes that eventually receive the same valid inputs.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if a crafted input makes consensus accept invalid state.
- Fast validation: Create a restart/replay test from persisted state and compare it with the pre-restart in-memory state.
