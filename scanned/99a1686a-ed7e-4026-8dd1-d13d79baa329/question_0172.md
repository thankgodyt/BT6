# Q172: forecast windows at their maximum allowed range in Ouroboros Consensus Storage

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.PerasCertDB with forecast windows at their maximum allowed range and era-boundary slot, block/header era tags, network version, serialized query tags, ledger-view forecast timing, and predecessor chain context, then force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/PerasCertDB.hs / Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.PerasCertDB
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or normal block producer delivers blocks, headers, queries, or encoded messages around an era boundary through supported node protocols.
- Attacker controls: era-boundary slot, block/header era tags, network version, serialized query tags, ledger-view forecast timing, and predecessor chain context.
- Exploit idea: Drive `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.PerasCertDB` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.PerasCertDB` through the production entrypoint using forecast windows at their maximum allowed range; verify whether the path can force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A block at an era boundary must be interpreted under exactly one era for header, body, ledger, forecast, and protocol validation.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential Critical if a crafted boundary block causes honest nodes to disagree on block validity or accept invalid state.
- Fast validation: Replay the same multi-era chain live and from persisted storage and compare hard-fork summary, selected tip, and ledger state hash.
