# Q3750: forecast windows at their maximum allowed range in Ouroboros Consensus HardFor

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.Combinator.State.Types with forecast windows at their maximum allowed range and era-boundary slot, block/header era tags, network version, serialized query tags, ledger-view forecast timing, and predecessor chain context, then force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/HardFork/Combinator/State/Types.hs / Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.Combinator.State.Types
- Entrypoint: Remote peer or normal block producer delivers blocks, headers, queries, or encoded messages around an era boundary through supported node protocols.
- Attacker controls: era-boundary slot, block/header era tags, network version, serialized query tags, ledger-view forecast timing, and predecessor chain context.
- Exploit idea: Drive `Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.Combinator.State.Types` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.Combinator.State.Types` through the production entrypoint using forecast windows at their maximum allowed range; verify whether the path can force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A block at an era boundary must be interpreted under exactly one era for header, body, ledger, forecast, and protocol validation.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if an era-boundary, forecast, ledger-view, query, or network-version mismatch breaks cross-era consensus invariants for production nodes.
- Fast validation: Create a hard-fork combinator test with boundary-slot blocks and assert header era, body era, ledger view, and protocol state agree.
