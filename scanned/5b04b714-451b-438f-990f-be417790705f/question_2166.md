# Q2166: restart in FlavorImplSpecificTrace

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach FlavorImplSpecificTrace with restart after receiving duplicate valid and invalid blocks and peer-delivered blocks, duplicate block hashes, rollback depth, immutable boundary timing, volatile suffix contents, snapshot cadence, and restart timing, then force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Storage/LedgerDB/TraceEvent.hs / FlavorImplSpecificTrace
- Entrypoint: Remote peers drive normal block synchronization so accepted, rejected, duplicate, or rolled-back blocks are persisted, replayed, snapshotted, or cleaned up by production storage.
- Attacker controls: peer-delivered blocks, duplicate block hashes, rollback depth, immutable boundary timing, volatile suffix contents, snapshot cadence, and restart timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `FlavorImplSpecificTrace` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.LedgerDB.TraceEvent` through the production entrypoint using restart after receiving duplicate valid and invalid blocks; verify whether the path can force repeated expensive validation before decisive rejection before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: Persisted blocks, indexes, snapshots, and ledger states must replay to the same selected chain as the pre-restart node state.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if a restart after normal synchronization selects a different chain than live validation.
- Fast validation: Construct a VolatileDB/ImmutableDB boundary test with duplicate and stale blocks and assert indexes resolve the same point before and after cleanup.
