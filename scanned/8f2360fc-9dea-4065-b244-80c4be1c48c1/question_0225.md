# Q225: reordered rollbacks and forward headers in LoEAndGDDConfig

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach LoEAndGDDConfig with reordered rollbacks and forward headers and peer message ordering, withheld block bodies, advertised points, node-to-node version choice, local client queries, and reconnect timing, then make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable in production Ouroboros consensus behavior?

## Target
- File/function: ouroboros-consensus-diffusion/src/ouroboros-consensus-diffusion/Ouroboros/Consensus/Node/Genesis.hs / LoEAndGDDConfig
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged node-to-node or node-to-client peer sends supported protocol messages, rollbacks, block bodies, queries, or object-diffusion data in adversarial order.
- Attacker controls: peer message ordering, withheld block bodies, advertised points, node-to-node version choice, local client queries, and reconnect timing.
- Exploit idea: Drive `LoEAndGDDConfig` in `Ouroboros.Consensus.Node.Genesis` through the production entrypoint using reordered rollbacks and forward headers; verify whether the path can make an invalid block or ledger state appear acceptable before all consensus, ledger, storage, and era-specific guards have succeeded.
- Invariant to test: A peer withholding, duplicating, or reordering data must not starve processing of a valid competing chain.
- Expected Cardano/Intersect impact: Potential High if adversarial peer scheduling makes honest nodes prefer different chains or starves valid block processing.
- Fast validation: Create an io-sim network with malicious and honest peers delivering headers, blocks, rollbacks, and disconnects in adversarial order.
