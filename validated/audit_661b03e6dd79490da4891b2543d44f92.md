### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Stub Accepts All Certificates Without Verification, Enabling Chain Selection Manipulation - (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

### Summary

The production `BlockSupportsPeras` instance unconditionally accepts every inbound Peras certificate without performing any cryptographic or quorum validation. Any unprivileged peer can send a crafted `PerasCert` that boosts an arbitrary block's weight in chain selection, causing an honest node to prefer a non-canonical chain.

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` typeclass defines `validatePerasCert`, which is supposed to verify that a certificate carries a valid aggregate BLS signature over the correct election ID and candidate, that all listed voters were eligible committee members, and that the quorum threshold was met. The production catch-all instance, however, is a stub that unconditionally returns `Right`:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub is wired directly into the production certificate-ingestion path. `processCerts` in `ObjectPool/PerasCert.hs` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams` for every certificate received from a peer:

```haskell
makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB systemTime chainDB =
  ObjectPoolWriter
    { ...
    , opwAddObjects = \certs ->
        processCerts
          systemTime
          (ChainDB.getPerasCertIds chainDB)
          -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
          (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
          (void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB)
          certs
    ...
    }
``` [2](#0-1) 

Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, every certificate passes and is forwarded to `addPerasCertAsync`, which enqueues a `ChainSelAddPerasCert` message. The ChainSel background thread then adds the certificate to `PerasCertDB` and triggers chain selection for the boosted block:

```haskell
chainSelSync cdb@CDB{..} (ChainSelAddPerasCert cert varProcessed) = do
  ...
  certRes <- lift $ lift $ join $ atomically $ PerasCertDB.addCert cdbPerasCertDB cert
  ...
  lift $ chainSelectionForBlock cdb BlockCache.empty boostedHdr noPunishment
``` [3](#0-2) 

`implGetWeightSnapshot` then materialises a `PerasWeightSnapshot` from every certificate in the DB, including the attacker-injected ones:

```haskell
implGetWeightSnapshot PerasCertDbEnv{pcdbState} = do
  WithFingerprint pcds fp <- readTVar pcdbState
  let weights =
        mkPerasWeightSnapshot
          [ (getPerasCertBoostedBlock cert, getPerasCertBoost cert)
          | cert <- Map.elems (pcdsCertsByTicket pcds)
          ]
  pure (WithFingerprint weights fp)
``` [4](#0-3) 

Chain selection uses this snapshot to compute `wsvWeightBoost` for every candidate fragment:

```haskell
weightedSelectView bcfg weights = \case
  AF.Empty{} -> EmptyFragment
  frag@(_ AF.:> (getHeader1 -> hdr)) ->
    NonEmptyFragment
      WeightedSelectView
        { wsvBlockNo = blockNo hdr
        , wsvWeightBoost = weightBoostOfFragment weights frag
        , wsvTiebreaker = tiebreakerView bcfg hdr
        }
``` [5](#0-4) 

A candidate with a fraudulent boost can satisfy `preferCandidate` and cause the node to switch to a non-canonical fork:

```haskell
preferCandidate cfg ours cand =
  case compare (wsvTotalWeight ours) (wsvTotalWeight cand) of
    LT -> ShouldSwitch (Heavier $ Comparing ...)
    ...
``` [6](#0-5) 

### Impact Explanation

An unprivileged peer can craft a `PerasCert` that claims to boost any block on any fork. Because no signature, quorum, or eligibility check is performed, the certificate is stored in `PerasCertDB` and its boost is included in every subsequent chain-selection comparison. If the attacker-chosen block is on a minority or adversarial fork, the honest node will compute a higher `wsvTotalWeight` for that fork and switch to it, diverging from the canonical chain. This is a **Critical** bypass of Peras certificate verification that enables unauthorized certificate acceptance and chain-selection manipulation.

### Likelihood Explanation

The ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol is a public, peer-facing interface. Any connected peer can submit a `PerasCert` message. No authentication, stake ownership, or key material is required. The stub is in the default catch-all instance used for all block types until a proper per-era instance is provided, so the attack surface covers every node running this code with Peras diffusion enabled.

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` with a real implementation that:
1. Verifies the aggregate BLS signature over `(electionId, candidate)` using the aggregated public keys of the listed voters.
2. Checks that every listed voter was an eligible committee member with positive stake at the relevant epoch.
3. Confirms that the combined vote weight meets the quorum threshold.

Until the real implementation is in place, the ObjectDiffusion layer should refuse to forward `PerasCert` objects to `addPerasCertAsync` (i.e., gate the feature behind a runtime flag that is off by default).

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect to a node with Peras diffusion enabled.
2. Construct a `PerasCert` with `pcCertRound = <any round>` and `pcCertBoostedBlock = <tip of an adversarial fork>`.
3. Send it via the ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol.
4. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert`, which returns `Right` unconditionally.
5. `addPerasCertAsync` enqueues the cert; `chainSelSync` adds it to `PerasCertDB`.
6. `implGetWeightSnapshot` includes the fraudulent boost in the weight map.
7. The next call to `constructPreferableCandidates` / `preferAnchoredCandidate` computes a higher `wsvTotalWeight` for the adversarial fork and returns `ShouldSwitch`, causing the node to adopt the non-canonical chain.
