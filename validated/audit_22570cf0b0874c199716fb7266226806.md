### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Stub Always Accepts Any Peer-Supplied Certificate, Enabling Chain Selection Weight Manipulation - (File: `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The production `validatePerasCert` implementation is a stub that unconditionally returns `Right` for every certificate, regardless of content. An unprivileged peer can inject arbitrarily crafted Peras certificates via the ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol. These certificates are stored in `PerasCertDB`, inflate the `PerasWeightSnapshot`, and cause chain selection to prefer a non-canonical chain when Peras is enabled.

---

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` typeclass defines `validatePerasCert` as the gate that must accept or reject a `PerasCert` before it enters the node's certificate store. The only production instance — a catch-all for all `StandardHash blk` — is an acknowledged stub:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub is the only instance; the comment at the instance head confirms it is a placeholder for all block types:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
``` [2](#0-1) 

The inbound certificate processing path in `processCerts` calls this validator and only rejects a batch when at least one `Left` is returned. Because the stub never returns `Left`, every certificate batch from every peer is unconditionally accepted:

```haskell
case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
  ([], validatedCerts) ->
    mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
  (errs, _) ->
    throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [3](#0-2) 

The production writer path (`makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`) passes `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams` as the validator and routes accepted certificates into `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, which triggers `chainSelSync`: [4](#0-3) 

`chainSelSync` adds the certificate to `PerasCertDB` and, if the boosted block is in the VolatileDB, immediately re-runs chain selection for that block: [5](#0-4) 

`implGetWeightSnapshot` builds the `PerasWeightSnapshot` directly from every certificate stored in `pcdsCertsByTicket`, with no post-storage validity check: [6](#0-5) 

Chain selection then computes `wsvWeightBoost` from this snapshot for every candidate fragment and uses `wsvTotalWeight` (block number + boost) to decide which chain to prefer: [7](#0-6) 

---

### Impact Explanation

When Peras is enabled, an unprivileged peer can inject a certificate whose `pcCertBoostedBlock` points to any block in the VolatileDB. The node assigns that block a `PerasWeight` boost equal to `perasWeight mkPerasParams`. If the attacker targets a block on a minority fork, the inflated `wsvTotalWeight` of that fork can exceed the honest chain's total weight, causing the node to switch to the non-canonical chain. This is a chain selection error that lets an unprivileged peer make an honest node prefer a less-secure chain beyond the intended security assumptions.

**Impact class: High** — chain selection bug that lets an unprivileged peer make an honest node prefer a non-canonical chain.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

The ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol for Peras certificates is a public network endpoint reachable by any peer. No stake, keys, or privileged access are required to send a `PerasCert` message. The only deduplication guard is a round-number membership check (`Set.member roundNo pcdsCertIds`), which an attacker trivially bypasses by using a fresh `pcCertRound` value for each injected certificate. The attack is repeatable and requires no special timing. Likelihood is **High** whenever Peras is enabled on a node.

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` with a real implementation that verifies:
- The certificate's committee signature(s) against the registered Peras committee for the claimed round.
- That `pcCertBoostedBlock` is a known, valid block at the correct slot for the claimed round.
- That the certificate's round number is within the current valid window (not expired, not from the future).

Until real validation is implemented, the `processCerts` path should not be reachable from untrusted peers when Peras is enabled. The existing TODO at `https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120` tracks this work.

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Enable Peras on a private testnet node (set `eraPerasRoundLength` in era params).
2. Connect as an unprivileged peer via the ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol.
3. Send a `PerasCert` with:
   - `pcCertRound` = any round number not yet in the node's `PerasCertDB`.
   - `pcCertBoostedBlock` = the `Point` of a block on a minority fork present in the target node's VolatileDB.
4. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert`, which returns `Right ValidatedPerasCert{..}` unconditionally.
5. The certificate is stored; `implGetWeightSnapshot` now includes a boost for the minority-fork block.
6. `chainSelSync` calls `chainSelectionForBlock` for the boosted block.
7. `weightedSelectView` computes an inflated `wsvTotalWeight` for the minority fork.
8. `preferAnchoredCandidate` returns `ShouldSwitch`, and the node adopts the non-canonical chain. [1](#0-0) [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)
