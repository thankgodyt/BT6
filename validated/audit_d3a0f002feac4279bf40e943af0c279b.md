### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Bypass Allows Unauthorized Chain Weight Boost - (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

### Summary

The degenerate `BlockSupportsPeras` instance used for all block types unconditionally accepts every inbound Peras certificate without performing any cryptographic or quorum validation. An unprivileged peer can craft and send an arbitrary `PerasCert` that will be stored in the `PerasCertDB` and trigger chain selection, granting a configurable weight boost (`PerasWeight 15` by default) to any block the attacker chooses. This is a direct bypass of Peras certificate/vote verification checks.

### Finding Description

In `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`, the `BlockSupportsPeras` instance that covers all block types implements `validatePerasCert` as an unconditional stub:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub skips all checks that a real implementation must perform: quorum verification (that votes from ≥ 3/4 of stake signed the certificate), aggregate BLS signature verification, round-number bounds, and voter eligibility. Every certificate is wrapped in `ValidatedPerasCert` and returned as `Right`.

The production certificate ingestion path in `processCerts` calls this function for every certificate received from a peer:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` then stores the `ValidatedPerasCert` in the `PerasCertDB` and, via `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, enqueues a chain-selection event. [3](#0-2) 

`chainSelSync` in `ChainSel.hs` then processes the certificate: it looks up the boosted block in the `VolatileDB` and calls `chainSelectionForBlock`, which re-evaluates chain selection using the `WeightedSelectView` that adds `vpcCertBoost` to the chain's total weight. [4](#0-3) 

The `WeightedSelectView` comparison uses `wsvTotalWeight = BlockNo + wsvWeightBoost`, so a certificate with `PerasWeight 15` adds 15 to the effective chain length of the boosted chain: [5](#0-4) 

### Impact Explanation

An unprivileged peer can send a crafted `PerasCert` pointing to any block in the `VolatileDB`. Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, the certificate is accepted, stored, and used to boost that block's chain weight by `perasWeight params` (currently 15). If the attacker's target chain is within 15 blocks of the current selection, the node will switch to it. This constitutes:

- **Bypass of Peras certificate checks** enabling unauthorized certificate acceptance (Critical per scope).
- **Chain selection manipulation** — an honest node can be made to prefer a non-canonical chain without the attacker holding any stake or producing valid votes.

The analog to the external report is precise: just as a user can stake zero-duration right before reward distribution to capture rewards they did not earn, an attacker here can inject a zero-cost certificate right before chain selection to capture a weight boost they did not earn through legitimate quorum voting.

### Likelihood Explanation

The Peras certificate mini-protocol is a network-facing interface. Any peer that can connect to a node can send `PerasCert` objects. The stub is in production source (`src/ouroboros-consensus`), not in tests. The only precondition is that the boosted block must already be present in the node's `VolatileDB` (i.e., the attacker's block was already diffused). No keys, stake, or operator access are required.

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` with a real implementation that:
1. Verifies the aggregate BLS signature over the certificate's `(roundNo, boostedBlock)` payload against the public keys of the claimed voters.
2. Checks that the claimed voters are members of the correct voting committee for the given round (using the snapshotted stake distribution for that epoch).
3. Verifies that the total stake of the signers meets the quorum threshold (`≥ 3/4 + safetyMargin`).
4. Checks that the certificate's round number is within the valid window (`≤ perasCertMaxRounds` old).

Until a real implementation is available, the Peras certificate ingestion path should be disabled or gated behind a feature flag so that the stub cannot be reached from the network.

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect to a target node as an unprivileged peer via the Peras certificate mini-protocol.
2. Identify a block `B` in the node's VolatileDB that is on a fork you wish to promote (e.g., a block 14 blocks behind the current tip on an alternative chain).
3. Construct a `PerasCert { pcCertRound = <any>, pcCertBoostedBlock = pointOf(B) }` — no valid signatures or quorum proof needed.
4. Send the certificate to the node.
5. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert` → `Right (ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCertBoost = PerasWeight 15 })`.
6. The certificate is stored; `chainSelSync` triggers `chainSelectionForBlock` for `B`.
7. The alternative chain's `wsvTotalWeight` increases by 15, making it heavier than the current selection (which has 14 more blocks but 0 boost).
8. The node switches to the attacker's chain. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6)
