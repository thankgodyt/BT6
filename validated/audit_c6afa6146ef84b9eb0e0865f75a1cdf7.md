### Title
Unconditional `validatePerasCert` Acceptance Enables Unauthorized Peras Certificate Injection and Chain Selection Manipulation - (File: `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The production `BlockSupportsPeras` instance implements `validatePerasCert` as a stub that unconditionally returns `Right` for every inbound certificate, performing zero cryptographic or committee-membership verification. Because this is the only instance wired into the live object-diffusion pipeline, any unprivileged peer can craft a `PerasCert` for an arbitrary round and arbitrary block point, have it accepted without rejection, and cause the receiving node to apply a full Peras boost weight to that block during chain selection.

---

### Finding Description

The sole production instance of `BlockSupportsPeras` is declared as a catch-all:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub is directly wired into the production inbound-certificate pipeline via `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
-- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` calls `validateCert` on every certificate not already in the DB, then unconditionally adds all that pass:

```haskell
processCerts systemTime alreadyInDbSTM validateCert addCert certs = do
  alreadyInDb <- atomically alreadyInDbSTM
  let certsNotAlreadyInDb = filter (not . (`Set.member` alreadyInDb) . getPerasCertRound) certs
  now <- systemTimeCurrent systemTime
  case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
    ([], validatedCerts) ->
      mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
    (errs, _) ->
      throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [3](#0-2) 

Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, the `(errs, _)` branch is unreachable. Every certificate a peer sends passes the guard and is added to the `PerasCertDB`, which then triggers chain selection for the boosted block:

```haskell
certRes <- lift $ lift $ join $ atomically $ PerasCertDB.addCert cdbPerasCertDB cert
...
lift $ chainSelectionForBlock cdb BlockCache.empty boostedHdr noPunishment
``` [4](#0-3) 

The same pattern applies to `validatePerasVote`, which skips signature verification and only checks stake-distribution membership, allowing any peer to forge votes attributed to any legitimate voter: [5](#0-4) 

---

### Impact Explanation

An unprivileged peer can craft a `PerasCert{pcCertRound = r, pcCertBoostedBlock = p}` for any round `r` and any block point `p` it wishes to boost. The receiving node will:

1. Accept the certificate unconditionally (no signature, no committee-membership check).
2. Insert it into `PerasCertDB`, assigning it the full configured `perasWeight` boost.
3. Trigger `chainSelectionForBlock` for the boosted block, potentially switching the node's preferred chain to one the attacker controls.

Because the `PerasCertDB` deduplicates only by round number, an attacker can inject one certificate per round, covering every active round, and steer chain selection across the entire volatile window. This constitutes a **bypass of Peras certificate verification** enabling unauthorized chain-selection manipulation — a High-severity consensus-safety impact.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

The object-diffusion mini-protocol is reachable by any peer that can establish a connection to the node. No keys, stake, or privileged access are required. The attacker only needs to send a well-formed CBOR-encoded `PerasCert` message. The stub is the only production instance; there is no fallback or feature-flag that re-enables real verification.

---

### Recommendation

1. Implement real cryptographic and committee-membership verification inside `validatePerasCert` before the object-diffusion pipeline is enabled on any network where Peras is active. At minimum, verify the aggregate BLS signature against the claimed voter set and confirm that the voter set constitutes a valid quorum under the current committee selection.
2. Apply the same fix to `validatePerasVote`: verify the individual vote signature before accepting the vote into the `PerasVoteDB`.
3. Until real validation is in place, gate the object-diffusion handlers behind a feature flag that is disabled by default, so the stub cannot be reached from the network.

---

### Proof of Concept

**Attacker-controlled entry path:**

```
Peer TCP connection
  → ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol (PerasCert diffusion)
  → makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB.opwAddObjects
  → processCerts (PerasCert.hs:164)
  → validateCert = validatePerasCert mkPerasParams   ← always Right
  → addCert = void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync
  → chainSelSync / chainSelectionForBlock            ← chain selection triggered
```

**Crafted message (pseudocode):**

```
-- Attacker sends a PerasCert boosting an arbitrary block B at round R
let maliciousCert = PerasCert
      { pcCertRound      = R          -- any round the attacker chooses
      , pcCertBoostedBlock = pointOf B -- any block point in the volatile window
      }
-- Node accepts it unconditionally, applies perasWeight boost to B,
-- and may switch its preferred chain to one containing B.
```

The `PerasCertDB` deduplication (`Set.member roundNo pcdsCertIds`) only prevents the same round from being inserted twice; it does not prevent injection of certificates for rounds the attacker was never legitimately elected for. [6](#0-5)
