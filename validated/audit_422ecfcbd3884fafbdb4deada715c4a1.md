### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Unconditionally Bypassed — Any Peer Can Inject Arbitrary Certificates into Chain Selection - (File: `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

### Summary

The universal `BlockSupportsPeras` instance implements `validatePerasCert` to unconditionally return `Right` (success) for every inbound certificate, performing no cryptographic or protocol checks. Both production object-diffusion pool writers (`makePerasCertPoolWriterFromCertDB` and `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`) call this stub directly. An unprivileged peer can therefore inject arbitrary, fabricated Peras certificates over the object-diffusion mini-protocol; each certificate is accepted, stored, and its chain-selection boost applied without any validation.

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` typeclass declares `validatePerasCert` as the mandatory gate for accepting inbound Peras certificates:

```haskell
validatePerasCert ::
  PerasCfg blk ->
  PerasCert blk ->
  Either (PerasValidationErr blk) (ValidatedPerasCert blk)
```

The single universal instance that covers all block types implements this method as an unconditional pass-through:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub is wired directly into both production pool writers. `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` (the path used by a running node) passes `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams` as the validation callback to `processCerts`:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)  -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` calls `validateCert` on every inbound certificate and, if all pass (which they always do), adds them to the database:

```haskell
case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
  ([], validatedCerts) ->
    mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
  (errs, _) ->
    throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [3](#0-2) 

Because `validatePerasCert` never returns `Left`, the `errs` branch is unreachable. Every certificate a peer sends is accepted and forwarded to `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, which triggers chain-selection side-effects.

A second, compounding stub exists in the same universal instance: `getPerasCertInBlock _ = Nothing` means certificates embedded in blocks are never extracted, so the on-chain certificate state tracked in `shelleyLedgerLatestPerasCertRound` is also never updated from real blocks. [4](#0-3) 

### Impact Explanation

Peras certificates carry a `perasWeight` boost (default value `15`) that is added to the chain-selection weight of the boosted block. A peer that can inject an accepted certificate pointing to an arbitrary block can cause an honest node to prefer a non-canonical or adversarially chosen chain segment, bypassing the normal Praos longest-chain rule. This is a direct bypass of Peras certificate/vote authorization checks enabling unauthorized certificate acceptance and chain-selection manipulation.

**Impact class:** Critical — bypass of Peras certificate validation that enables unauthorized certificate acceptance and chain-selection divergence.

### Likelihood Explanation

The object-diffusion mini-protocol for Peras certificates is reachable by any peer that connects to the node. No special privileges, keys, or stake are required. The attacker only needs to craft a `PerasCert` with a desired `pcCertRound` and `pcCertBoostedBlock` and send it over the wire. The stub is in the universal instance used for all block types, so no era-specific override exists to save the node.

### Recommendation

1. Remove or gate the universal `BlockSupportsPeras` instance. It must not be used in production code paths. Each concrete block type (Cardano HFC eras) must provide a real instance that performs cryptographic aggregate-signature verification and committee-membership checks before returning `Right`.
2. Until a real instance exists, the pool writers `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromCertDB` and `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` must not be wired into a live node. The TODO comments already acknowledge this; the code must enforce it (e.g., by making the validation callback a required argument that cannot be satisfied by the stub).
3. Implement `getPerasCertInBlock` for Cardano block types so that on-chain certificate state is correctly maintained.

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect to a node as an unprivileged peer via the object-diffusion mini-protocol for Peras certificates.
2. Send a `PerasCert` with `pcCertRound = <any round>` and `pcCertBoostedBlock = <point of a target block>`.
3. `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` → `processCerts` → `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert` → `Right (ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCertBoost = PerasWeight 15 })`.
4. `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync` is called; chain selection now applies a weight boost of 15 to the attacker-chosen block.
5. The honest node may switch to or prefer the adversarially boosted chain segment, diverging from the canonical chain. [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6)
