### Title
Peras Certificate Verification Bypass: `validatePerasCert` Unconditionally Accepts Any Certificate, Enabling Forged-Certificate Chain Selection Manipulation - (File: `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The production implementation of `validatePerasCert` in the `BlockSupportsPeras` instance is a stub that unconditionally returns `Right` for every certificate it receives, performing zero cryptographic or semantic validation. This stub is wired directly into the live Peras certificate ingest pipeline (`processCerts`) used by both `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromCertDB` and `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`. An unprivileged peer can therefore inject an arbitrary forged `PerasCert` — with any round number and any boosted-block pointer — and the node will accept it, store it in the `PerasCertDB`, and trigger chain selection for the boosted block.

---

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` typeclass defines `validatePerasCert` as the mandatory gate for all inbound Peras certificates. The universal instance for all block types implements it as:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub is passed directly as the `validateCert` argument in both production pool-writer constructors:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams) -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
``` [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

The `processCerts` function that calls it reads the current set of known round numbers from the DB atomically, filters out already-known rounds, then calls `validateCert` on the remainder. Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, the `partitionEithers` call always produces an empty error list, and every certificate in the batch is unconditionally added:

```haskell
processCerts systemTime alreadyInDbSTM validateCert addCert certs = do
  alreadyInDb <- atomically alreadyInDbSTM
  let certsNotAlreadyInDb = filter (not . (`Set.member` alreadyInDb) . getPerasCertRound) certs
  now <- systemTimeCurrent systemTime
  case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
    ([], validatedCerts) ->
      mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
    (errs, _) ->
      throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [4](#0-3) 

Once a certificate is added via `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`, it is forwarded to `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, which triggers `chainSelSync`. That function checks only whether the boosted block is too old (below the immutable tip slot) and whether the block is present in the `VolatileDB`; it does not re-validate the certificate's authenticity: [5](#0-4) 

The checks that *should* be performed — aggregate BLS signature verification, VRF eligibility proof verification, quorum threshold check, committee membership check — are all defined in `implVerifyCert` for the `WFALS` and `EveryoneVotes` committee schemes but are never called from the ingest path: [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

The analog to the external report is direct: just as `updateWorkerDeploymentConfigWithSig` accepted any replayed signature because it performed no nonce/uniqueness check, `validatePerasCert` accepts any certificate because it performs no cryptographic check at all. Both root causes are "the validation gate is absent," and both allow an unprivileged network actor to inject a message that triggers a privileged state change.

---

### Impact Explanation

**Critical — Bypass of Peras certificate/signature validation enabling unauthorized certificate acceptance and chain selection manipulation.**

A forged certificate pointing to an adversary-controlled block that is present in the node's `VolatileDB` will be accepted, stored, and used to boost that block's chain weight. Because Peras certificates add a configurable `perasWeight` (default 15) to the boosted block's chain, a single injected certificate can make a minority chain appear heavier than the honest majority chain, causing the node to switch to the adversary's fork. This directly violates the chain-selection security assumption of the Peras protocol extension.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

Any peer that can establish an object-diffusion mini-protocol connection — i.e., any unprivileged network peer — can send a crafted `PerasCert` message. No stake, no key material, and no prior knowledge beyond the target block's hash (observable from the public chain) is required. The attack requires only a single well-formed CBOR-encoded `PerasCert` message with a valid round number not yet in the DB.

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` implementation with a call to the appropriate `implVerifyCert` for the active committee scheme (e.g., `WFALS.implVerifyCert` or `EveryoneVotes.implVerifyCert`). This must verify:

1. The aggregate BLS vote signature over `(electionId, candidate)`.
2. VRF eligibility proofs for non-persistent voters.
3. That the set of voters meets the quorum stake threshold.
4. That all voter seat indices are within bounds for the current committee.

The `validatePerasCert` method in `BlockSupportsPeras` should receive the current `VotingCommittee` as an additional parameter (or via the `PerasCfg blk` type) so that committee membership and stake distribution can be checked against the ledger state at the relevant epoch.

---

### Proof of Concept

```
1. Attacker connects to a Cardano node running with Peras enabled via the
   object-diffusion mini-protocol for PerasCerts.

2. Attacker observes a block B_adv on a minority fork with hash H_adv,
   present in the target node's VolatileDB (e.g., recently gossiped).

3. Attacker constructs a PerasCert CBOR message:
     { pcCertRound    = <any round R not yet in the node's PerasCertDB>
     , pcCertBoostedBlock = H_adv
     , pcVoters       = <empty or arbitrary bitmap>
     , pcSignature    = <zeroed or random bytes> }

4. Attacker sends this certificate to the node via the object-diffusion
   protocol.

5. processCerts calls validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert
   => always returns Right (ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCert = cert, vpcCertBoost = 15 })

6. The certificate is stored in PerasCertDB with round R.

7. ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync triggers chainSelSync, which finds B_adv in
   the VolatileDB and runs chainSelectionForBlock for it.

8. The chain containing B_adv now has weight boosted by 15 (perasWeight).
   If this exceeds the honest chain's weight, the node switches to the
   adversary's fork.

9. The node now considers the adversary's chain as its preferred chain,
   diverging from the honest network.
