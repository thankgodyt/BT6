### Title
`validatePerasCert` Stub Always Returns `Right`, Enabling Unauthenticated Peras Certificate Injection and Chain Selection Manipulation - (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The universal `BlockSupportsPeras` instance in `SupportsPeras.hs` provides a stub `validatePerasCert` that unconditionally returns `Right` — accepting every inbound Peras certificate without any cryptographic check. Because this instance is the one actually wired into the production certificate-diffusion pipeline, an unprivileged peer can inject arbitrary `PerasCert` objects that are stored in the `PerasCertDB` and used to boost chain weight, causing honest nodes to prefer an attacker-controlled chain.

---

### Finding Description

`BlockSupportsPeras` is the typeclass that governs Peras certificate and vote validation. Its `validatePerasCert` method is supposed to cryptographically verify a certificate before it is admitted to the node's `PerasCertDB`.

The repository ships a single, catch-all instance for all `StandardHash blk` types:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

The function ignores every field of `cert` and returns `Right` unconditionally. No aggregate BLS signature is verified, no quorum membership is checked, no round-number bounds are enforced.

This stub is the implementation that is actually called in the production inbound-certificate path. `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` (and its `CertDB`-only sibling) both pass `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams` as the validation callback to `processCerts`:

```haskell
makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB systemTime chainDB =
  ObjectPoolWriter
    { opwAddObjects = \certs ->
        processCerts
          systemTime
          (ChainDB.getPerasCertIds chainDB)
          -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
          (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
          (void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB)
          certs
    ...
    }
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` partitions the results of `validateCert` into successes and failures; because `validatePerasCert` never produces a `Left`, every certificate in every batch is classified as valid and forwarded to `addCert`: [3](#0-2) 

Once stored, the certificate is consumed by `chainSelSync`, which triggers chain selection for the boosted block: [4](#0-3) 

Chain selection compares candidates using `WeightedSelectView`, where `wsvTotalWeight = blockNo + weightBoost`. A fraudulent certificate adds `perasWeight params` to the boosted block's chain weight, potentially making a shorter or otherwise non-preferred fork appear heavier: [5](#0-4) 

The contrast with the real committee implementations (`EveryoneVotes`, `WFALS`) is stark — both call `verifyVoteSignature` / `verifyAggregateVoteSignature` and check VRF outputs before accepting anything: [6](#0-5) 

The stub instance was explicitly introduced as a temporary measure to make the code compile while the real HFC plumbing is absent (issue #73 / #120), but it is the only instance in scope for production block types, so it is the one that runs.

---

### Impact Explanation

An unprivileged peer that can speak the Peras certificate diffusion mini-protocol can inject a `PerasCert` naming any block it chooses as the boosted block. The certificate is stored without any signature check and immediately triggers chain selection. Because `wsvTotalWeight` adds the full `perasWeight` boost to the named block's chain, the attacker can make an honest node switch to a fork it would otherwise reject, or prevent it from switching to the canonical chain. This is a direct chain-selection safety failure: the node accepts an unauthorized certificate and may adopt a non-canonical chain, violating the Peras security assumption that only legitimately quorum-certified blocks receive a boost.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

Any peer that can establish a connection and send Peras certificate objects can trigger this. No key material, stake, or privileged access is required. The certificate diffusion mini-protocol is reachable from the public network whenever Peras is enabled. The TODO comments and the linked GitHub issues confirm this is a known placeholder, not an intentional design choice, making it a realistic production risk once Peras is activated.

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` in the universal `BlockSupportsPeras` instance with a real implementation that:

1. Verifies the aggregate BLS signature over the certificate's `(roundNo, boostedBlock)` payload against the aggregate public key of the claimed quorum members.
2. Checks that the claimed voters are eligible committee members for the stated round (VRF / persistent-member check).
3. Verifies that the total stake of the signers meets the quorum threshold.

Until the HFC plumbing is complete, the stub should at minimum reject all certificates (`Left PerasValidationErr`) rather than accept all of them, so that the diffusion layer cannot be used to manipulate chain selection. The same applies to `validatePerasVote`, which currently skips signature verification entirely. [7](#0-6) 

---

### Proof of Concept

**Attacker-controlled entry path:**

1. Peer connects and the node creates a `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` writer for the Peras certificate diffusion mini-protocol.
2. Peer sends a batch containing one crafted `PerasCert { pcCertRound = R, pcCertBoostedBlock = attackerBlock }` where `attackerBlock` is a block on the attacker's fork.
3. `opwAddObjects` calls `processCerts ... (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams) ...`.
4. `validatePerasCert` returns `Right ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCert = cert, vpcCertBoost = perasWeight mkPerasParams }` — no signature checked.
5. `processCerts` sees zero `Left` results; calls `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB cert`.
6. `chainSelSync` fires for `attackerBlock`; `weightBoostOfFragment` now adds `perasWeight` to every fragment containing `attackerBlock`.
7. `preferCandidate` compares `wsvTotalWeight`; the attacker's fork now appears heavier and the node switches to it. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)
