### Title
Unconditional Peras Certificate Acceptance Bypasses Chain-Selection Authorization — (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The production `validatePerasCert` implementation is a stub that unconditionally returns `Right` for every inbound certificate, regardless of content. Any unprivileged peer can inject arbitrary Peras certificates via the object-diffusion mini-protocol. These certificates are stored in the `PerasCertDB` and used directly to boost blocks during chain selection, allowing an attacker to manipulate which chain the node considers canonical.

---

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` type class defines `validatePerasCert` as the gating check before a certificate is accepted. The universal degenerate instance — applied to all block types — implements this check as an unconditional success:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub is wired directly into the production inbound certificate handler `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`, which is the live path for certificates received from peers:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
``` [2](#0-1) 

The `processCerts` function calls this validator on every inbound certificate. Because it always returns `Right`, every certificate passes and is forwarded to `addCert` (or `addPerasCertAsync` for the ChainDB path):

```haskell
case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
  ([], validatedCerts) ->
    mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
  (errs, _) ->
    throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [3](#0-2) 

Once stored, certificates are read back as a `PerasWeightSnapshot` and fed into `chainSelectionForBlock` and `constructPreferableCandidates`, where they directly influence which candidate chain is preferred:

```haskell
(invalid, curChain, weights) <-
  atomically $
    (,,)
      <$> (forgetFingerprint <$> readTVar cdbInvalid)
      <*> Query.getCurrentChain cdb
      <*> (forgetFingerprint <$> Query.getPerasWeightSnapshot cdb)
``` [4](#0-3) 

The `PerasCertDB.implAddCert` function performs no independent validation — it trusts that the certificate was already validated before being passed in: [5](#0-4) 

---

### Impact Explanation

**High — Chain selection manipulation by an unprivileged peer.**

A Peras certificate boosts the weight of a specific block during chain selection. By injecting a certificate with an arbitrary `pcCertBoostedBlock` pointing to a block on a competing fork, an attacker can cause the node to assign extra weight to that fork and switch away from the canonical chain. This violates the chain-selection security assumptions of Ouroboros Praos/Peras and constitutes unauthorized certificate acceptance enabling a non-canonical chain preference.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

**Medium.** The object-diffusion mini-protocol for Peras certificates is wired into the production node. Any peer that can establish a connection and speak the protocol can send a crafted certificate. No stake, keys, or special privileges are required. The only limiting factor is whether the Peras protocol is currently active on the target network; the code path is compiled and deployed regardless.

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` with a real implementation that verifies:
1. The certificate's aggregate signature against the claimed committee members' verification keys.
2. That the claimed voters are eligible members of the committee for the given round (stake-weighted sortition check).
3. That the boosted block's slot falls within the valid range for the certificate's round number.
4. That the quorum threshold is met by the attested stake.

Until the real implementation is in place, the object-diffusion inbound path for Peras certificates should either be disabled or gated behind a feature flag that is off by default.

---

### Proof of Concept

**Attacker-controlled entry path:**

1. Peer connects to a node and speaks the Peras certificate object-diffusion mini-protocol.
2. Peer sends a `PerasCert` with:
   - `pcCertRound = <any round number not yet in the DB>`
   - `pcCertBoostedBlock = <hash of a block on a competing fork>`
3. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert`.
4. `validatePerasCert` returns `Right (ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCert = cert, vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params })` unconditionally. [6](#0-5) 
5. The certificate is stored in `PerasCertDB` via `addPerasCertAsync`.
6. `chainSelSync` processes the certificate: it reads the updated `PerasWeightSnapshot` (now including the attacker's boost), calls `chainSelectionForBlock` for the boosted block, and `preferAnchoredCandidate` now assigns extra weight to the fork containing the boosted block. [7](#0-6) 
7. If the boosted fork is otherwise competitive (e.g., same block number), the node switches to it, diverging from the canonical chain.
