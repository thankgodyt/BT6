### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Stub Unconditionally Accepts Any Certificate — (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The production `BlockSupportsPeras` instance's `validatePerasCert` implementation is a stub that unconditionally returns `Right` (success) for every certificate it receives, performing zero cryptographic or structural verification. Any unprivileged peer that can submit a crafted `PerasCert` to the node will have it accepted and stored, allowing it to boost an arbitrary block in Peras chain selection without holding any stake or producing a valid aggregate signature.

---

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` typeclass defines `validatePerasCert` as the gate that must verify a Peras certificate before it is stored and used to boost a block's chain-selection weight. The repository ships a single catch-all instance for all block types:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

No Cardano-era-specific override of this instance exists in the repository. Consequently, every call to `validatePerasCert` in the production code path resolves to this stub and returns `Right` unconditionally, regardless of the certificate's content.

The same pattern applies to `validatePerasVote`: it only checks whether the voter's ID appears in the stake distribution map, but performs no signature verification, no committee-eligibility proof, and no VRF check:

```haskell
validatePerasVote _params stakeDistr vote
  | Just stake <- lookupPerasVoteStake vote stakeDistr =
      Right ValidatedPerasVote { vpvVote = vote, vpvVoteStake = stake }
  | otherwise =
      Left PerasValidationErr
``` [2](#0-1) 

Additionally, `stakeAboveThreshold` — the quorum gate used by `votesReachQuorum` — carries an explicit developer warning that the `PerasVoteStake` values and the `PerasParams` quorum threshold may be in incompatible units (absolute vs. relative), meaning the quorum check itself may be meaningless even when it is reached:

```haskell
-- TODO: this function assumes that the 'PerasVoteStake' and the quorum
-- threshold used in 'PerasParams' are expressed in the same units. ...
-- this function only makes sense when both values are relative (normalized)
-- values, so we should either normalize the 'PerasVoteStake' before calling
-- this function, or change this function to accept a stake distribution and
-- perform the normalization internally.
stakeAboveThreshold :: PerasParams -> PerasVoteStake -> Bool
``` [3](#0-2) 

The `BlockSupportsPeras` class is wired into the live object-diffusion pipeline. Votes arrive via `makePerasVotePoolWriterFromChainDB` / `makePerasVotePoolWriterFromVoteDB`, which call `validatePerasVote` and then `PerasVoteDB.addVote`. The `PerasVoteDB` implementation (`implAddVote`) calls `updatePerasRoundVoteStates`, which calls `votesReachQuorum` → `stakeAboveThreshold` → `forgePerasCert`. The `forgePerasCert` stub also always returns `Right`: [4](#0-3) 

Certificates are added to the `ChainDB` via `addPerasVoteWithAsyncCertHandling`: [5](#0-4) 

The `PerasVoteDB` implementation stores the forged cert and returns it as `AddedPerasVoteAndGeneratedNewCert`: [6](#0-5) 

---

### Impact Explanation

**Bypass of Peras certificate/vote verification checks enabling unauthorized certificate acceptance.**

Because `validatePerasCert` always succeeds and `validatePerasVote` skips all cryptographic checks, an unprivileged peer can:

1. Submit votes with any `PerasVoterId` that appears in the stake distribution, carrying any stake value, without a valid committee-eligibility proof or vote signature.
2. Accumulate enough such votes to trigger `stakeAboveThreshold` (which may itself be trivially satisfied due to the unit-mismatch bug).
3. Cause the node to forge and store a `ValidatedPerasCert` boosting an arbitrary block by `perasWeight`.
4. Shift chain selection in favour of an adversarially chosen block, potentially causing the node to diverge from the honest chain.

This maps directly to the "Critical — Bypass of certificate/vote verification checks that enables unauthorized certificate acceptance" impact class.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

The Peras object-diffusion pipeline is active in the codebase and wired into the `ChainDB`. Any peer connected to the node can submit votes via the miniprotocol. Because no signature or eligibility proof is checked, the attack requires only knowledge of a `PerasVoterId` present in the current stake distribution (publicly observable on-chain) and the ability to send protocol messages — both trivially available to any unprivileged peer.

---

### Recommendation

1. **Implement `validatePerasCert`**: Verify the aggregate BLS signature over the certificate's `(electionId, candidate)` pair against the aggregated verification keys of the claimed voters, and confirm that the claimed voters' combined weight exceeds the quorum threshold. The `WFALS`/`EveryoneVotes` committee implementations in `Committee/WFALS.hs` and `Committee/EveryoneVotes.hs` already provide `implVerifyCert` with the correct logic; wire it into the `BlockSupportsPeras` instance. [7](#0-6) 

2. **Implement `validatePerasVote`**: Verify the vote signature and, for non-persistent voters, the VRF eligibility proof before accepting a vote. Again, `implVerifyVote` in `WFALS.hs` provides the reference implementation. [8](#0-7) 

3. **Fix the `stakeAboveThreshold` unit mismatch**: Normalize `PerasVoteStake` to a relative value (dividing by total committee stake) before comparing against the relative quorum threshold, or change the function signature to accept the total stake and perform normalization internally. [3](#0-2) 

---

### Proof of Concept

```
Attacker (unprivileged peer):
  1. Observe the current PerasVoteStakeDistr (public ledger data).
     Pick any PerasVoterId V with stake S in the distribution.
  2. Craft a PerasVote:
       { pvVoteRound  = R          -- any round
       , pvVoteBlock  = adversarialBlockPoint
       , pvVoteVoterId = V
       }
     No signature or VRF proof is required.
  3. Send the vote via the object-diffusion miniprotocol.
  4. validatePerasVote checks only Map.lookup V stakeDistr → succeeds.
     vpvVoteStake = S is assigned without normalization.
  5. Repeat with enough distinct voter IDs until
     stakeAboveThreshold fires (trivially, since S values may be
     absolute lovelace while the threshold is a small Rational).
  6. updatePerasRoundVoteStates calls votesReachQuorum → forgePerasCert.
     forgePerasCert stub returns Right unconditionally.
  7. ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCertBoost = perasWeight } is stored in ChainDB.
  8. Chain selection now boosts adversarialBlockPoint by perasWeight,
     potentially causing the node to switch to the adversarial chain.
