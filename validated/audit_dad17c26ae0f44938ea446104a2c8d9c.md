### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Bypass via Unconditional `Right` Stub in `validatePerasCert` — (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The production `BlockSupportsPeras` instance's `validatePerasCert` implementation is an incomplete stub that unconditionally accepts every inbound Peras certificate without performing any cryptographic or semantic checks. This stub is wired directly into the live certificate diffusion path. An unprivileged peer can send a crafted `PerasCert` with an arbitrary round number and boosted block, causing the receiving node to apply a chain-selection weight boost to an adversarially-chosen block.

---

### Finding Description

The universal `BlockSupportsPeras` instance (covering all `StandardHash blk`) defines `validatePerasCert` as:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub returns `Right` for **every** certificate regardless of content — no signature check, no committee membership check, no round-number plausibility check, no boosted-block existence check.

This stub is the validator passed directly into the production certificate diffusion writer in both the `PerasCertDB`-backed and `ChainDB`-backed pool writers:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)  -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
``` [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

The `processCerts` function that consumes this validator accepts all certificates that pass it and adds them to the database, triggering chain selection side-effects:

```haskell
case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
  ([], validatedCerts) ->
    mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
  (errs, _) ->
    throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [4](#0-3) 

The `ChainDB`-backed path then calls `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, which triggers `chainSelSync` and applies the `perasWeight` boost (currently 15 units) to the adversarially-nominated block in chain selection: [5](#0-4) 

Note that the `WFALS` and `EveryoneVotes` committee schemes do have proper `implVerifyCert` implementations with full cryptographic checks: [6](#0-5) 

However, these are **not** wired into the `BlockSupportsPeras` instance used by the production diffusion path. The stub instance is the one that is active.

---

### Impact Explanation

**High — Chain selection manipulation via unauthorized certificate acceptance.**

An adversary controlling any peer can send a `PerasCert` naming an arbitrary block as the boosted block. Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, the certificate is stored and triggers chain selection. The boosted block receives `perasWeight = 15` extra weight, which can cause the honest node to prefer a non-canonical chain over the canonical one. This directly undermines the chain-selection security guarantees that Peras is designed to provide, and inverts the protocol's intent: instead of honest certificates strengthening the canonical chain, adversarial certificates can strengthen a non-canonical fork.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

**High.** The vulnerable code path is the default production path for all inbound Peras certificates received over the object diffusion mini-protocol. Any peer that can connect to the node can exploit this. No key material, stake, or privileged access is required — only the ability to send a well-formed `PerasCert` CBOR message. The `PerasCert` type is simple (a round number and a block point): [7](#0-6) 

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` implementation with a real one that:
1. Verifies the certificate's aggregate BLS signature against the claimed committee members' public keys (as `implVerifyCert` in `WFALS.hs` and `EveryoneVotes.hs` already does).
2. Verifies that all claimed voters are eligible committee members for the certificate's round.
3. Verifies that the total weight of the voters meets the quorum threshold.
4. Verifies that the boosted block's slot is within the valid range for the certificate's round.

The existing `implVerifyCert` in `Committee/WFALS.hs` and `Committee/EveryoneVotes.hs` provide the correct template. The `BlockSupportsPeras` instance must be wired to the appropriate committee scheme rather than using the stub. The tracked issue is https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120.

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect to a node as an unprivileged peer via the object diffusion mini-protocol for Peras certificates.
2. Send a `PerasCert` with `pcCertRound = N` and `pcCertBoostedBlock = <point of a block on a minority fork>`.
3. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert`, which returns `Right (ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCert = cert, vpcCertBoost = PerasWeight 15 })` unconditionally.
4. The certificate is stored in `PerasCertDB` and `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync` is called.
5. `chainSelSync` applies the 15-unit weight boost to the minority-fork block.
6. If the minority fork is within `perasWeight` units of the canonical chain's weight, the node switches to the minority fork — a chain-selection manipulation achieved with zero cryptographic material. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)
