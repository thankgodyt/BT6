### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Stub Unconditionally Accepts Any Inbound Certificate, Enabling Unauthorized Chain Boost by Any Peer - (File: `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

### Summary

The sole production `BlockSupportsPeras` instance implements `validatePerasCert` as a stub that unconditionally returns `Right` for every certificate, performing zero cryptographic or structural checks. This is the exact function called by the live inbound-certificate processing path (`processCerts`). Any unprivileged peer can craft a `PerasCert` for an arbitrary round and arbitrary block, have it accepted without verification, stored in the `PerasCertDB`, and used to boost a block in chain selection — potentially causing the node to prefer a non-canonical chain.

### Finding Description

**Root cause — stub validation in the only production instance**

`BlockSupportsPeras` declares `validatePerasCert` as the mandatory gate for accepting inbound Peras certificates. The only instance in the codebase is a universal stub for all `StandardHash blk`:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
```

No signature is verified, no committee membership is checked, no round bounds are enforced, and no boosted-block existence is confirmed. Every certificate is unconditionally promoted to `ValidatedPerasCert`. [1](#0-0) 

**Attacker-controlled entry path — ObjectDiffusion inbound pipeline**

`makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` wires this stub directly into the live inbound certificate handler:

```haskell
opwAddObjects = \certs ->
    processCerts
      systemTime
      (ChainDB.getPerasCertIds chainDB)
      (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)   -- ← always Right
      (void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB)
      certs
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` reads the set of already-known certificate round numbers atomically, filters out duplicates, calls `validateCert` on the remainder, and adds every "validated" certificate:

```haskell
processCerts systemTime alreadyInDbSTM validateCert addCert certs = do
  alreadyInDb <- atomically alreadyInDbSTM
  let certsNotAlreadyInDb = filter (not . (`Set.member` alreadyInDb) . getPerasCertRound) certs
  now <- systemTimeCurrent systemTime
  case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
    ([], validatedCerts) ->
      mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
    (errs, _) ->
      throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [3](#0-2) 

Because `validatePerasCert` never returns `Left`, the `(errs, _)` branch is unreachable. Every certificate that is not already in the DB is added unconditionally.

**Downstream chain-selection impact**

`chainSelSync` in `ChainSel.hs` processes each accepted certificate: it adds it to the `PerasCertDB` and, if the boosted block is in the VolatileDB, immediately triggers chain selection for that block. The Peras weight boost attached to the certificate (`vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params`) is then factored into the chain-selection comparison, potentially making a non-canonical fork appear heavier than the honest chain. [4](#0-3) 

The `PerasCertDB` itself correctly deduplicates by round number, so a single forged certificate per round is sufficient — the attacker does not need to flood the node. [5](#0-4) 

**Analog to the external report**

The external report's `onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd` modifier claimed to enforce access control but only checked a timestamp, leaving the function callable by anyone. Here, `validatePerasCert` claims to enforce certificate validity but performs no checks, leaving the certificate acceptance path open to any peer. Both share the same root-cause pattern: a guard that is structurally present but semantically empty.

### Impact Explanation

This is a **Critical** bypass of Peras certificate/signature validation. An unprivileged peer with a single TCP connection can:

1. Craft a `PerasCert{pcCertRound = r, pcCertBoostedBlock = adversarialBlock}` for any round `r` and any block point `adversarialBlock` (e.g., the tip of a withheld adversarial fork).
2. Send it via the ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol.
3. The certificate is accepted without any cryptographic check, stored in the `PerasCertDB`, and triggers chain selection for `adversarialBlock`.
4. If the Peras weight boost exceeds the honest chain's advantage, the node switches to the adversarial fork — a consensus safety failure.

This matches the allowed impact: **Critical — bypass of Peras certificate checks that enables unauthorized certificate acceptance**, and **High — chain selection bug that lets an unprivileged peer make an honest node prefer a non-canonical chain**.

### Likelihood Explanation

The attack requires only network connectivity. The ObjectDiffusion protocol is designed to accept objects from any connected peer; there is no peer-authentication layer that would restrict who can submit certificates. The stub is the only instance of `BlockSupportsPeras` in the repository and is unconditionally wired into the production pipeline. No special knowledge, stake, or keys are required.

### Recommendation

Before enabling Peras in any production or testnet deployment, replace the stub with a real implementation of `validatePerasCert` that:

1. Verifies the aggregate BLS/committee signature against the voting committee for the certificate's round.
2. Confirms the certificate's round number falls within the acceptable window relative to the current chain tip.
3. Confirms the boosted block exists and is a valid chain point.
4. Enforces that the certificate represents a genuine quorum of eligible voters.

The existing `implVerifyCert` logic in `WFALS.hs` and `EveryoneVotes.hs` provides the cryptographic primitives needed; the gap is that they are not yet plumbed into the `BlockSupportsPeras` instance. [6](#0-5) 

### Proof of Concept

```
Attacker (any peer) connects to an honest node running Peras.

1. Attacker observes the honest chain tip T and a withheld adversarial block A
   that branches off k blocks before T.

2. Attacker constructs:
     cert = PerasCert
       { pcCertRound    = currentRound
       , pcCertBoostedBlock = blockPoint A
       }

3. Attacker sends [cert] via the ObjectDiffusion certificate mini-protocol.

4. processCerts:
     alreadyInDb = {}  (cert is new)
     validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert = Right (ValidatedPerasCert cert boost)
     addCert (WithArrivalTime now validatedCert)   -- accepted

5. chainSelSync:
     PerasCertDB.addCert → AddedPerasCertToDB
     chainSelectionForBlock cdb BlockCache.empty boostedHdr noPunishment
     → node now considers A's chain to have weight = length(A's chain) + boost

6. If boost > (length(T) - length(A)), the node switches to A's fork.
   Consensus safety is violated: the node has accepted a non-canonical chain
   on the basis of a certificate it never cryptographically verified.
