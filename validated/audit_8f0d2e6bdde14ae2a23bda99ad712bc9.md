### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Unconditionally Accepts All Certificates — (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The degenerate `BlockSupportsPeras` instance used for all block types implements `validatePerasCert` as a stub that **always returns `Right`** (success) without performing any cryptographic or structural validation. Any Peras certificate received from an unprivileged peer is unconditionally accepted, added to the `PerasCertDB`, and its weight boost applied to the boosted block, directly influencing chain selection.

---

### Finding Description

The vulnerability class from M-7 is an **incomplete guard function**: a check that is supposed to block certain inputs uses wrong or missing identifiers, so the restriction is never enforced. The analog here is `validatePerasCert` in the degenerate `BlockSupportsPeras` instance.

The degenerate instance is declared for all `StandardHash blk` types with an explicit comment acknowledging it is a placeholder:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This function is called directly from `processCerts`, the inbound certificate handler for the Peras miniprotocol:

```haskell
case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
  ([], validatedCerts) ->
    mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
  (errs, _) ->
    throw (PerasCertInboundException errs)
``` [2](#0-1) 

Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, the `(errs, _)` branch is never taken. Every certificate from every peer is treated as valid and added to the `PerasCertDB`.

The pool writer wires this directly to the `ChainDB`:

```haskell
(validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
``` [3](#0-2) 

Once a certificate is in the `PerasCertDB`, its weight boost is applied to the boosted block via `PerasWeightSnapshot`, which is then used in `preferAnchoredCandidate` and `compareAnchoredFragments` to decide chain selection:

```haskell
wsvWeightBoost = weightBoostOfFragment weights frag
``` [4](#0-3) 

The chain selection comparison uses total weight (block number + boost):

```haskell
wsvTotalWeight wsv =
  PerasWeight (unBlockNo (wsvBlockNo wsv)) <> wsvWeightBoost wsv
``` [5](#0-4) 

A secondary incomplete guard also exists in `checkPreferTheirsOverOurs` in the ChainSync client, which hardcodes `emptyPerasWeightSnapshot` instead of using the real weight snapshot when deciding whether to disconnect from a peer beyond the forecast horizon:

```haskell
-- TODO: remove this entire check, see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/64
emptyPerasWeightSnapshot
``` [6](#0-5) 

This means a peer serving a legitimately heavier (Peras-boosted) but shorter chain would be incorrectly disconnected from, compounding the primary issue.

---

### Impact Explanation

**Primary (Critical — certificate validation bypass):** An unprivileged peer can craft and send arbitrary Peras certificates. Because `validatePerasCert` performs no validation, every certificate is accepted. The attacker can:

1. Assign a weight boost to any block hash of their choosing.
2. Make an adversarial chain appear heavier than the honest chain in `preferAnchoredCandidate`, causing the node to switch to the adversarial chain.
3. Bypass the Peras certificate/vote check that is supposed to authorize which blocks receive weight boosts.

This matches the allowed impact: *"Critical. Bypass of … certificate/vote verification bypass … that enables unauthorized block, vote, or certificate acceptance."*

**Secondary (High — chain selection bug):** The `checkPreferTheirsOverOurs` guard uses `emptyPerasWeightSnapshot`, so when Peras is active, a peer serving the canonical (heavier) chain beyond the forecast horizon is incorrectly disconnected from, causing the node to remain on a less-heavy chain.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

Peras is implemented in production source files (not test/mock files) and the certificate inbound path is wired to the `ChainDB`. The `ObjectPoolWriter` mechanism is part of the live node diffusion layer. Once Peras is activated on a network (private testnet or mainnet), any connected peer can exploit this by sending crafted certificates. No stake, keys, or operator access is required — only a network connection.

---

### Recommendation

1. **`validatePerasCert`**: Replace the stub with real validation covering at minimum: certificate round number bounds, boosted block point validity, aggregate signature verification against the voting committee, and quorum threshold checks. Until real validation is implemented, the function should return `Left PerasValidationErr` (reject all) rather than `Right` (accept all), to fail safe.

2. **`checkPreferTheirsOverOurs`**: Replace `emptyPerasWeightSnapshot` with the actual current `PerasWeightSnapshot` from the `ChainDB`, or remove the check entirely as the TODO suggests, to avoid incorrectly disconnecting from peers serving a legitimately heavier chain.

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect a crafted peer to a node with Peras enabled.
2. Send a `PerasCert` with `pcCertBoostedBlock` pointing to any block on an adversarial fork and `pcCertRound` set to a valid round number.
3. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert`, which returns `Right ValidatedPerasCert{..}` unconditionally.
4. The certificate is added to `PerasCertDB` via `implAddCert`.
5. `chainSelSync` is triggered for the boosted block; `preferAnchoredCandidate` now computes `wsvWeightBoost` for the adversarial fork using the injected boost.
6. If the adversarial fork's total weight exceeds the honest chain's total weight, `ShouldSwitch` is returned and the node adopts the adversarial chain. [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8)
