### Title
Stub `validatePerasCert` Implementation Unconditionally Accepts Any Peer-Supplied Peras Certificate, Enabling Unauthorized Chain-Selection Manipulation — (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The global `BlockSupportsPeras` instance, explicitly marked as a "degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile," provides a `validatePerasCert` implementation that unconditionally returns `Right` for every certificate it receives, performing zero cryptographic or structural validation. Because this instance is used in the production Peras certificate inbound pipeline (`processCerts` / `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`), any unprivileged peer can inject an arbitrary, structurally well-formed `PerasCert` message that will be accepted, stored in the `PerasCertDB`, and used to trigger chain selection for the boosted block — without any signature, quorum, or eligibility check.

---

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` typeclass declares `validatePerasCert` as the mandatory gate for accepting a Peras certificate received from the network:

```haskell
validatePerasCert ::
  PerasCfg blk ->
  PerasCert blk ->
  Either (PerasValidationErr blk) (ValidatedPerasCert blk)
```

The only concrete instance in the codebase is the catch-all degenerate instance:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This stub skips every check that a real implementation must perform: aggregate signature verification, committee eligibility, quorum threshold, round/block consistency, and replay protection.

The production inbound certificate pipeline calls this function directly. `processCerts` in `ObjectPool/PerasCert.hs` is the handler for all certificates arriving from peers:

```haskell
makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB systemTime chainDB =
  ObjectPoolWriter
    { opwAddObjects = \certs ->
        processCerts
          systemTime
          (ChainDB.getPerasCertIds chainDB)
          -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
          (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
          (void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB)
          certs
    ...
    }
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` partitions the validation results and only rejects a batch when at least one `Left` is returned:

```haskell
case partitionEithers (validateCert <$> certsNotAlreadyInDb) of
  ([], validatedCerts) ->
    mapM_ (addCert . WithArrivalTime now) validatedCerts
  (errs, _) ->
    throw (PerasCertValidationError errs)
``` [3](#0-2) 

Because `validatePerasCert` never returns `Left`, the `(errs, _)` branch is unreachable. Every certificate passes, is timestamped, and is forwarded to `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, which stores it in the `PerasCertDB` and triggers chain selection for the boosted block:

```haskell
chainSelSync cdb@CDB{..} (ChainSelAddPerasCert cert varProcessed) = do
  ...
  -- Trigger chain selection for the boosted block.
  lift $ chainSelectionForBlock cdb BlockCache.empty boostedHdr noPunishment
``` [4](#0-3) 

The weight boost applied to the boosted block is `perasWeight params`, a non-zero protocol parameter, so the injected certificate materially shifts the chain-selection comparison:

```haskell
wsvTotalWeight wsv =
  PerasWeight (unBlockNo (wsvBlockNo wsv)) <> wsvWeightBoost wsv
``` [5](#0-4) 

---

### Impact Explanation

An unprivileged peer can craft a `PerasCert` naming any block hash it chooses as the boosted block. The node will accept it unconditionally, add the weight boost to that block's chain fragment, and potentially switch its preferred chain to one it would otherwise reject. This constitutes:

- **Bypass of Peras certificate verification** — the entire cryptographic and quorum-based authorization for a certificate is absent.
- **Unauthorized chain-selection manipulation** — the attacker can steer an honest node toward a non-canonical or adversarially controlled chain by boosting a block on a minority fork.

This matches the allowed impact: *"Critical. Bypass of … Peras voting or certificate checks … that enables unauthorized … certificate acceptance"* and *"High. Chain selection … bug that lets an unprivileged peer make an honest node prefer a non-canonical or less-secure chain."*

---

### Likelihood Explanation

The Peras certificate diffusion mini-protocol is a public, unauthenticated peer-to-peer channel. Any node that connects to a Peras-enabled node can send a `PerasCert` message. The attacker needs only to know a valid block hash (obtainable from the public chain) and construct a well-formed CBOR-encoded `PerasCert` record. No keys, stake, or privileged access are required. The `Serialise` instance for `PerasCert` is straightforward:

```haskell
instance Serialise (HeaderHash blk) => Serialise (PerasCert blk) where
  encode PerasCert{pcCertRound, pcCertBoostedBlock} =
    encodeListLen 2 <> encode pcCertRound <> encode pcCertBoostedBlock
``` [6](#0-5) 

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` with a real implementation that verifies:
1. The aggregate BLS/KES signature over the certificate body.
2. That the signers were members of the elected voting committee for the claimed round.
3. That the combined stake of the signers meets the configured quorum threshold (`perasQuorumThreshold`).
4. That the boosted block point is consistent with the claimed round number.

Until the real implementation is in place, the inbound certificate pipeline (`processCerts` / `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB`) should refuse all externally received certificates rather than accepting them unconditionally.

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect to a Peras-enabled node as an unprivileged peer via the Peras certificate diffusion mini-protocol.
2. Construct a `PerasCert` with `pcCertRound = <any round>` and `pcCertBoostedBlock = <hash of a block on a minority fork>`.
3. Send the certificate. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert`, which returns `Right` unconditionally.
4. The certificate is stored in `PerasCertDB` and `addPerasCertAsync` is called.
5. `chainSelSync` triggers `chainSelectionForBlock` for the boosted block.
6. The node's `WeightedSelectView` now assigns extra `PerasWeight` to the minority-fork block, potentially causing the node to switch its preferred chain to the attacker-controlled fork. [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8)
