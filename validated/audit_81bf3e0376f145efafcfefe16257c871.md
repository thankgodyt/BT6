### Title
Peras Certificate Validation Bypass Allows Unprivileged Peer to Manipulate Chain Selection - (File: `ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The universal `BlockSupportsPeras` instance's `validatePerasCert` implementation unconditionally accepts every inbound `PerasCert` without performing any cryptographic or quorum verification. An unprivileged peer can craft a certificate for any block in the node's VolatileDB and cause the receiving node to boost that block's chain-selection weight, potentially switching to a non-canonical fork.

---

### Finding Description

The `BlockSupportsPeras` type class defines `validatePerasCert` as the gate that must verify a certificate before it is stored and used in chain selection. The universal instance — explicitly marked as a temporary stub — implements this gate as an unconditional `Right`:

```haskell
-- TODO: perform actual validation against all
-- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
validatePerasCert params cert =
  Right
    ValidatedPerasCert
      { vpcCert = cert
      , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
      }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This instance is the **only** instance in the codebase (`instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk`), so it is the one used in all production code paths. [2](#0-1) 

The inbound certificate processing pipeline in `processCerts` calls this stub directly:

```haskell
processCerts
  systemTime
  (ChainDB.getPerasCertIds chainDB)
  (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)   -- always returns Right
  (void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB)
  certs
``` [3](#0-2) 

`processCerts` iterates over the peer-supplied certificate list, calls `validatePerasCert` on each one, and — because the function always returns `Right` — adds every certificate to the `PerasCertDB` and triggers chain selection: [4](#0-3) 

Once stored, the certificate is consumed by `chainSelSync`, which uses `pcCertBoostedBlock` to look up the block in the VolatileDB and re-runs chain selection with the fraudulent weight boost applied: [5](#0-4) 

The weight boost is applied via `wsvWeightBoost` in `WeightedSelectView`, which adds `perasWeight` (a fixed `PerasWeight` value, e.g. 15) to the block number of the boosted fragment, potentially making a shorter fork appear heavier than the honest chain: [6](#0-5) 

The structural parallel to the external report is exact:

| PayrollManager | Ouroboros Consensus |
|---|---|
| Loop over attacker-supplied `paymentTokens[]` | Loop over peer-supplied `[PerasCert blk]` in `processCerts` |
| No check that each token is linked to a signed transaction | `validatePerasCert` performs no quorum/signature check |
| Unauthorized token transfers | Unauthorized chain-weight boost |

---

### Impact Explanation

**High — Chain selection bug that lets an unprivileged peer make an honest node prefer a non-canonical chain.**

A peer can send a `PerasCert` whose `pcCertBoostedBlock` points to any block already present in the target node's VolatileDB (i.e., a block on a competing fork). Because `validatePerasCert` accepts it unconditionally, the node stores the certificate and re-runs chain selection with the fraudulent `perasWeight` boost. If the boosted fork's total weight (`blockNo + perasWeight`) exceeds the honest chain's weight, the node switches forks — accepting a non-canonical chain without any legitimate quorum of votes having been cast.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

**High.** The attack requires only:
1. A network connection to the target node (unprivileged peer).
2. Knowledge of a block hash present in the target's VolatileDB but not on its current chain (observable via ChainSync headers).
3. Crafting a `PerasCert` CBOR message with that block's point and any `PerasRoundNo` not already in the DB.

No key material, stake, or operator access is needed. The `processCerts` path is the standard inbound certificate handler used in production when Peras is enabled.

---

### Recommendation

Replace the stub `validatePerasCert` implementation with a real one that:
1. Verifies the certificate carries a valid aggregate BLS signature over `(electionId, candidate)` from a quorum of eligible committee members (analogous to `implVerifyCert` in `WFALS.hs` / `EveryoneVotes.hs`).
2. Checks that the total stake of the signing committee members exceeds the `perasQuorumStakeThreshold`.
3. Verifies VRF outputs for non-persistent voters where applicable.

Until the real implementation is in place, nodes should not enable Peras in production, or the `processCerts` path should reject all inbound certificates with an explicit error rather than silently accepting them. [7](#0-6) 

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect to a target node running with Peras enabled as an unprivileged peer via the ObjectDiffusion mini-protocol.
2. Observe via ChainSync that the node has received headers for a competing fork at block `B` (slot `s`, hash `h`) that is currently losing chain selection.
3. Craft a `PerasCert` CBOR payload:
   ```
   PerasCert { pcCertRound = <any round not yet in DB>, pcCertBoostedBlock = BlockPoint s h }
   ```
4. Send the certificate to the target node via the Peras certificate diffusion channel.
5. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert` → returns `Right (ValidatedPerasCert { vpcCertBoost = PerasWeight 15 })`.
6. The certificate is stored in `PerasCertDB` and `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync` triggers `chainSelSync`.
7. `chainSelSync` finds block `h` in VolatileDB, re-runs chain selection, and the fork's `wsvTotalWeight = blockNo(B) + 15` now exceeds the honest chain's `blockNo(tip)`.
8. The node switches to the attacker-boosted fork. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)
