### Title
`BlockSupportsPeras.validatePerasCert` Advertises Certificate Validation But Always Accepts Any Certificate — (`File: ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Block/SupportsPeras.hs`)

---

### Summary

The `BlockSupportsPeras` type class defines a `validatePerasCert` method that is supposed to cryptographically validate incoming Peras certificates before they influence chain selection. However, the single universal instance that covers all block types unconditionally returns `Right` (success) for every certificate, performing no validation whatsoever. This is the direct analog of the ERC-4906 finding: the interface advertises a contract (certificate validation) that it does not honor.

---

### Finding Description

`BlockSupportsPeras` is the consensus-layer interface for Peras protocol support. It declares `validatePerasCert` as the gate that must be passed before a certificate is accepted into the `PerasCertDB` and allowed to influence chain selection:

```haskell
validatePerasCert ::
  PerasCfg blk ->
  PerasCert blk ->
  Either (PerasValidationErr blk) (ValidatedPerasCert blk)
```

The only instance in the codebase is a universal degenerate one:

```haskell
-- TODO: degenerate instance for all blks to get things to compile
-- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/73
instance StandardHash blk => BlockSupportsPeras blk where
  ...
  -- TODO: perform actual validation against all
  -- possible 'PerasValidationErr' variants
  -- see https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/120
  validatePerasCert params cert =
    Right
      ValidatedPerasCert
        { vpcCert = cert
        , vpcCertBoost = perasWeight params
        }
``` [1](#0-0) 

This instance is not confined to tests. It is invoked directly in the production inbound certificate processing path. `makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB` constructs the pool writer that receives certificates from peers over the object-diffusion mini-protocol, and it passes `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams` as the validation function to `processCerts`:

```haskell
makePerasCertPoolWriterFromChainDB systemTime chainDB =
  ObjectPoolWriter
    { ...
    , opwAddObjects = \certs ->
        processCerts
          systemTime
          (ChainDB.getPerasCertIds chainDB)
          -- TODO replace when actual plumbing is in place
          (validatePerasCert mkPerasParams)
          (void . ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync chainDB)
          certs
    ...
    }
``` [2](#0-1) 

`processCerts` partitions the results of `validateCert` over the incoming batch: if all pass, every certificate is timestamped and forwarded to `addCert`; if any fail, the whole batch is rejected and the peer is disconnected. Because `validatePerasCert` always returns `Right`, the failure branch is unreachable for any certificate content. [3](#0-2) 

Each accepted certificate is then forwarded to `ChainDB.addPerasCertAsync`, which enqueues a `ChainSelAddPerasCert` event. The chain-selection handler `chainSelSync` processes it: it adds the certificate to the `PerasCertDB`, computes the boosted block's new `PerasWeight`, and calls `chainSelectionForBlock` for the boosted block, potentially switching the node to a different chain. [4](#0-3) 

The `WeightedSelectView` chain-order comparison uses `wsvTotalWeight`, which is `BlockNo + PerasWeight`. A certificate that grants a large enough `PerasWeight` boost to a block on a competing fork can make that fork heavier than the current selection, causing the node to roll back and switch. [5](#0-4) 

---

### Impact Explanation

An unprivileged peer can send a crafted `PerasCert` naming any block hash visible in the target node's VolatileDB as the `pcCertBoostedBlock`. Because `validatePerasCert` always succeeds, the certificate is accepted, stored, and used to boost that block's chain weight. If the boosted block sits on a fork that is otherwise shorter than the current selection, the artificial weight boost can flip the chain-order comparison, causing the honest node to abandon its current chain and adopt the adversary-chosen fork. This is a chain-selection safety failure triggered by a single unauthenticated network message, with no stake, keys, or operator access required.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

Block hashes are public. Any connected peer can observe which blocks are in the VolatileDB (via ChainSync) and craft a certificate targeting one of them. The object-diffusion protocol for Peras certificates is the direct inbound path. The only guard that could limit exploitation is whether Peras is enabled in the node configuration; the CHANGELOG notes it is disabled by default, but the vulnerable code path is unconditionally compiled in and active whenever Peras is enabled.

---

### Recommendation

Replace the universal degenerate instance with a proper per-era implementation that performs the required cryptographic checks (aggregate signature verification, quorum check against the stake distribution, round-number bounds, boosted-block existence on the chain). Until a correct implementation is ready, the `processCerts` inbound path should reject all certificates rather than accept them unconditionally, so that the placeholder cannot be exploited. The existing `TODO` references (`tweag/cardano-peras#73` and `tweag/cardano-peras#120`) should be treated as security-blocking items.

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Enable Peras on a private testnet node.
2. Connect an adversarial peer via the object-diffusion mini-protocol.
3. Observe (via ChainSync) a block hash `H` on a competing fork that is currently lighter than the node's selection by `D` block numbers.
4. Construct a `PerasCert { pcCertRound = r, pcCertBoostedBlock = BlockPoint s H }` where `perasWeight params > D`.
5. Send the certificate to the node. `processCerts` calls `validatePerasCert mkPerasParams cert`, which returns `Right` unconditionally.
6. `addPerasCertAsync` enqueues the certificate; `chainSelSync` adds it to the `PerasCertDB` and calls `chainSelectionForBlock` for `H`.
7. `WeightedSelectView` now computes the fork containing `H` as heavier; the node rolls back its current chain and adopts the adversary-chosen fork.
